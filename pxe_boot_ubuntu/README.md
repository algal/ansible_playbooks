PXE Boot
========

Setup a Ubuntu 12.04 server to PXE Boot other Ubuntu 12.04 servers.

Also includes some funky mdadm work as preseeding with Ubuntu doesn't do mdadm configuration very well. A lot, most, of this work was not done by me, instead best to look at this repository: https://github.com/jtopjian/cobbler-admin.
